        <h1>Zolo - Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Version:</strong> v1.0<br><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Information Zolo Collects</h2>
        <p>Upon sign-up, Zolo receives the user's email address, name, and profile photo from the chosen sign-in provider (such as Google). Zolo stores only the user's email address and immediately discards the name and profile photo. The email address is used solely to create and identify the user's account and to provide access to the service.</p>
        <p>Zolo also uses Firebase Analytics to collect information about how users interact with the app (for example, which screens are viewed and how often). This usage data may be linked to the user ID within Zolo to help analyze app performance and improve the user experience. Zolo doesn't sell this information or share it with third parties, and it is used only to enhance the app's functionality and the relevance of offers. Analytics data is stored securely within Firebase under Google's infrastructure. For more details, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>2. How Zolo Uses Data</h2>
        <p>Zolo uses the collected data to operate the service, improve performance, personalize the user experience, and maintain user security. No personal data is sold or shared with third parties except as required by law.</p>
        <p>In the future, usage data may also be analyzed to recommend offers or deals that better match user interests. Such processing will remain internal to Zolo and will not involve external sharing or targeted advertising.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>Data is stored securely using trusted cloud providers such as Firebase. Zolo implements appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the information against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. Users may request deletion of personal data at any time by contacting us.</p>

        <h2>4. User Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>You can schedule deletion of your account and personal data <strong>from within the app</strong>: open the main map screen and tap the <span class="u">Delete account</span> (trashcan icon) button. A pending deletion may be canceled at any time within the 30-day grace period by signing in again. After deletion completes, data cannot be recovered. For steps and FAQs, see <a href="https://zolo-deals.com/delete">https://zolo-deals.com/delete</a>.</p>
        <p>Aggregated, de-identified analytics may be retained.</p>
        <p>You can stop data collection by uninstalling the app (this is not a substitute for account deletion).</p>
        <p>For privacy questions or issues with the in-app deletion flow, contact <a href="mailto:support@zolo-deals.com">support@zolo-deals.com</a>.</p>

        <h2>5. Children and Age Requirements</h2>
        <p>The app is not directed to children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from them. If you believe a child has provided personal data, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@zolo-deals.com">support@zolo-deals.com</a>, and this information will be removed as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>Users must be at least 18 years old to use the app. Users under 18 may only use the app with parental or guardian consent.</p>

        <h2>6. Policy Updates</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be included in new app versions. Continued use of the app after such updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>For questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or your personal data, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:support@zolo-deals.com">support@zolo-deals.com</a></p>
